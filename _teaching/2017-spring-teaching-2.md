I was awarded the best Teaching Assistant Award for this course.
I worked with Prof. David Yau and Jit Biswas in Spring Semester 2017 for the [Computer System Engineering Course](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50005-computer-system-engineering). I was mainly responsible for the lab exercises and tutorial sessions.
