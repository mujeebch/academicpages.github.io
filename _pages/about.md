I am a Lecturer in the [Computer and Information Sciences Department](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/computerinformationsciences/) at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/). I completed Ph.D. in [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) under the supervision of Professor [Aditya Mathur](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/apm),  Professor [Jianying Zhou](http://jianying.space/) and Professor [Martin Ochoa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H5xFCoUAAAAJ&hl=en). I got an opportunity to work with Professor [Raheem Beyah](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/raheem-a-beyah) at Georgia Tech during my Ph.D. I received a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) under the supervision of Professor [Saewoong Bahk](http://netlab.snu.ac.kr/). I graduated with a BS in Communication Systems Engineering from [Institute of Space Technology](https://ist.edu.pk/) working with Professor [Iftekhar Mahmood
](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iftekharmahmood/).

During the Ph.D., I worked on the Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) security at the [iTrust Labs and testbeds](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/) in the SUTD. At SNU, South Korea my research was related to wireless communications. In particular, my MS thesis focused on [cross-tier interference mitigation in femtocell networks](http://s-space.snu.ac.kr/handle/10371/155484).  

Research Overview
======
My research interests are in the security and privacy of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Communication Systems and Critical Infrastructures. Previously, we have proposed non-cryptographic techniques to authenticate devices in an Industrial Control System (ICS). One such example is, exploiting [sensor measurement noise](https://www.growkudos.com/publications/10.1145%25252F3410447/reader), otherwise an undesirable feature into a fingerprint of a sensor. Our recent work has highlighted the challenges in applying [machine learning to CPS security](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3384941.3409588) and awarded the best paper prize at ACM CPSS workshop 2020. We are working towards solving those challenges, including Causal Inference, ML metrics for time series data and attack vs fault analysis in autonomous systems. Besides, we are working on exciting ideas related to side-channel based threat and defense technologies. For example, we have used [sounds produced by machines](https://ics2020.sched.com/event/eh1h/identifying-process-structure-and-parameters-using-side-channel-information) in an industrial plant to hack it. If this sounds interesting to you do get in touch, we are always looking for self-motivated individuals for Ph.D. and Postdoc positions.
